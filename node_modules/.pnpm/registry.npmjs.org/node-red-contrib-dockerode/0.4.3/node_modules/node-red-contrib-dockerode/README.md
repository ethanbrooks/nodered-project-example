This Node RED module connects Docker with Node-RED.

> Node-RED is a tool for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services in new and interesting ways.

## :sparkling_heart: Support my projects

I open-source almost everything I can, and I try to reply to everyone needing help using these projects. Obviously,
this takes time. You can integrate and use these projects in your applications _for free_! You can even change the source code and redistribute (even resell it).

However, if you get some profit from this or just want to encourage me to continue creating stuff, there are few ways you can do it:

-   Starring and sharing the projects you like :rocket:
-   [![PayPal][badge_paypal]][paypal-donations] **PayPal**— You can make one-time donations via PayPal. I'll probably buy a ~~coffee~~ tea. :tea:
-   [![Support me on using Brave Browser][badge_brave]][brave] **Brave**— It's free for you. Brave is a browser that improves the security and the access time of websites by blocking ads, trackers and scripts. Give the new Brave Browser a try and Brave will contribute to me on your behalf. :wink:
-   [![ko-fi](https://www.ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/T6T412CXA) **Ko-fi**— I'll buy a ~~tea~~ coffee. :coffee: :wink:
-   ![](./examples/bitcoin.png) **Bitcoin**—You can send me bitcoins at this address (or scanning the code): `3KDjCmXsGFYawmycXRsVwfFbphog117N8P`

Thanks! :heart:

## Usage

### Configuration:

#### docker.sock

- ***Using Node-RED in a Docker-Container***

The Node-RED container must have access to the docker.sock, so you have to add the docker-group ID to the container with <pre>docker run ... --group-add 250</pre> the ID 250 may be different on your system.

#### Exposing TCP-Daemon port

- ***hostname*** hostname of docker (e.g. "localhost")
- ***port*** port of docker (e.g. "2375")

In order to expose the docker-engine TCP daemon, you have to do the following:

- ***Docker for Windows / Docker Desktop:*** 
<br>Under Settings / General check "Expose daemon on tcp://localhost:2375 without TLS"

- ***Docker-CE***

See https://success.docker.com/article/how-do-i-enable-the-remote-api-for-dockerd

or: 

```
# File: /etc/default/docker
# Use DOCKER_OPTS to modify the daemon startup options.
#DOCKER_OPTS=""
DOCKER_OPTS="-H tcp://127.0.0.1:2375 -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock"
```

or: 

```
# File: /lib/systemd/system/docker.service
ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker daemon -H fd:// -H tcp://0.0.0.0:2375
```
